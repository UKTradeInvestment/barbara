Barbara Gordon is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books
published by DC Comics and related media. The character was created by William
Dozier, Julius Schwartz, and Carmine Infantino. At the request of the producers
of the 1960s Batman television series, DC editor Schwartz called for a new
female counterpart to the superhero Batman that could be introduced into
publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character
subsequently made her first comic book appearance as Batgirl in Detective
Comics No. 359, titled "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!" (1967), by writer
Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino.[1] Written as the daughter of Gotham
City police commissioner James Gordon, her civilian identity is given a
doctorate in library science and she is employed as head of Gotham City Public
Library, as well as later being elected to the United States Congress.

In addition to appearing in other DC publications, she receives her first
starring role in Batman Family which debuted in 1975, partnered with the
original Robin, Dick Grayson. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of
the character's Batgirl persona in Barbara Kesel's Batgirl Special No. 1, Alan
Moore's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke depicts the Joker shooting her
through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in paraplegia. In
subsequent stories, editor Kim Yale and writer John Ostrander establish the
character as a computer expert and information broker known as Oracle.
Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other
superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad No. 23
(1989). She is featured in the one-shot comic Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of
Prey (1996) written by Chuck Dixon, which later became the monthly title Birds
of Prey starring both characters. The series depicts her as a great intellect
uninhibited by her paralysis, skilled in the martial art of eskrima. Employing
Black Canary as her partner and field agent, Oracle later operates as the
leader of a full team of female crimefighters who engage in global espionage
missions, under writer Gail Simone. In 2011, following a company wide relaunch
of all DC Comics titles, the character's mobility is restored and she is given
a starring role in the eponymous Batgirl monthly comic, as well as Birds of
Prey, as part of The New 52.

Barbara Gordon is described as one of the most popular characters to appear
during the Silver Age of Comic Books and is also regarded as a pop icon due to
her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure.
She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the
Birds of Prey publication and as a disability icon. The character has been the
subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and
people living with disabilities in mainstream media. The events of The Killing
Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her
mobility, has been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists,
editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the
limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabled
characters existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and
medical science exceed the limitations of the real world. Barbara Gordon, as
both Batgirl and Oracle, has been adapted into various media relating to the
Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other
merchandise. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in both Comics Buyer's Guide's "100
Sexiest Women in Comics" and IGN's "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes".[2][3]
