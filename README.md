# UKTI Barbara

Barbara is a passive archival system, collecting all the interaction data it
can find, storing it in a structured system for easy retrieval and statistics
generation.  Maybe one day it'll have fancy charts!


## Colophon

But why *"Barbara"*? What better name for an archival system that Monitors All
The Things than that of [Barbara Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Gordon),
aka *Oracle*?
